PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """I will ask you to perform a task, your job is to come up with a series of simple commands in Python that will perform the task.
To help you, I will give you access to a set of tools that you can use. Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
Each instruction in Python should be a simple assignement.
The final result should be stored in a variable named `result`. You can also print the result if it makes sense to do so.
You should only use the tools necessary to perform the task.

Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French."

Tools:
- tool_0: This is a tool that translates text from French to English. It takes an input named `text` which should be the text in French and returns a dictionary with a single key `'translation_text'` that contains the translation in Enlish.
- tool_1: This is a tool that generates speech from a given text in English. It takes an input named `text` which should be the text in English and returns the path to a filename containing an audio of this text read.
- tool_2: This is a tool that answers question about images. It takes an input named `text` which should be the question in English and an input `image` which should be an image, and outputs a text that is the answer to the question.

Answer:
```py
translated_question = tool_0(text=question)['translation_text']
result = tool_2(text=translated_question, image=image)
print(f"The answer is {result}")
```

Task: "Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`."

Tools:
- tool_0: This is a tool that reads an English text out loud. It takes an input named `text` which whould contain the text to read (in English) and returns a waveform object containing the sound.
- tool_1: This is a tool that generates a description of an image. It takes an input named `image` which should be the image to caption, and returns a text that contains the description in English.
- tool_2: This is a tool that creates an image according to a text description. It takes an input named `text` which contains the image description and outputs an image.

Answer:
```py
result = tool_2(text=caption)
```
